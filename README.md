The Fabes Programming Language.

## About

This is an ambitious work in progress for me. My motivation here is not to create the world's next great programming language, but to learn and have fun.

## Lexer

Test (what I've got so far) by running `go run lexer.go`. The output will be a token stream of `dreaming.fbs`.
